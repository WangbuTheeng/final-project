# Fix: Resolve migration conflicts and table existence issues

## üö® Issues Fixed

### 1. Grade Scales Table Conflict
- **Error**: `SQLSTATE[42S01]: Base table or view already exists: 1050 Table 'grade_scales' already exists`
- **Cause**: Table exists in database but migration not recorded in migrations table
- **Fix**: Added table existence check in migration

### 2. Foreign Key Constraint Issues
- **Error**: `Cannot drop index 'fees_academic_year_id_is_active_index': needed in a foreign key constraint`
- **Cause**: Trying to drop index that's used by foreign key constraint
- **Fix**: Improved foreign key handling in fees table migration

### 3. Ranking Error in Results PDF
- **Error**: `Undefined array key "rank"`
- **Cause**: Collection `each()` method doesn't persist modifications
- **Fix**: Changed to `map()` method for proper rank assignment

### 4. Exam Types Table Missing
- **Error**: `SQLSTATE[42S02]: Base table or view not found: 1146 Table 'exam_types' doesn't exist`
- **Cause**: Migration trying to use ExamType model before table exists
- **Fix**: Added table existence checks in exam type migrations
