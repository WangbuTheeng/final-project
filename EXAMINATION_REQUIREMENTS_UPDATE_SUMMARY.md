## Required Manual Steps

### 1. Run Database Migrations
```bash
# Option 1: Run specific migrations
php artisan migrate --path=database/migrations/2025_07_24_000001_update_exams_for_examination_requirements.php
php artisan migrate --path=database/migrations/2025_07_24_000002_update_exam_types_for_examination_requirements.php

UPDATE exams SET status = 'incomplete' WHERE status = 'ongoing';
```
